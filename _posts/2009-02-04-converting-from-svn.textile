You're probably reading this for one of a few reasons:

* You're a longtime SVN user and want to see what Git is all about
* You want to know how much of a pain switching to Git is
* You hate SVN and want to see what's better

Instead of contributing to the mass of tutorials already written about the subject, I figured I would take the <s>easy</s> useful way out and compose a list of great tutorials on how to accomplish a migration to Git for those who are familiar with SVN. If you have more links, please comment away and I'll add them in.

*Transition Tutorials*
_These tutorials describe just how different the two version control systems are and go over how they work on a (mostly) high level._

* "Git SVN Workflow":http://andy.delcambre.com/2008/03/04/git-svn-workflow.html
* "GitSvnComparsion":http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/GitSvnComparsion
* "An introduction to git-svn for Subversion/SVK users and deserters":http://utsl.gen.nz/talks/git-svn/intro.html

*Command Tutorials*
_These tutorials focus on learning commands that perform common actions between the two systems._

* "Git - SVN Crash Course":http://git.or.cz/course/svn.html
* "Howto use Git and svn together":http://flavio.castelli.name/howto_use_git_with_svn
* "git[-svn] in 30 minutes":http://michael-prokop.at/blog/2007/12/03/git-svn-in-30-minutes/

*Migration Tutorials*
_These tutorials elaborate on how you can import your history from SVN and how to work with others who may not be converted yet._
