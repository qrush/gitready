Usually "ignoring files":http://gitready.com/beginner/2009/01/19/ignoring-files.html is quite simple with Git. However, you may need to quickly hide changes in a file, perhaps for an entire development session or other reasons. Luckily there's a simple way around this, thanks to some clever manual diving from "Eelco Wiersma":http://www.pagebakers.nl/2009/01/29/git-ignoring-changes-in-tracked-files/.

His main problem was using @git commit -a@, which automatically adds files that are modified into the commit object. This is a neat shortcut, but make sure you "understand the staging area":http://gitready.com/beginner/2009/01/18/the-staging-area.html if you find yourself running this command all the time.

So, to temporarily ignore changes in a certain file, run:

@git update-index --assume-unchanged <file>@

Then when you want to track changes again:

@git update-index --no-assume-unchanged <file>@

Obviously there's quite a few caveats that come into play with this. If you @git add@ the file directly, it will be added to the index. Merging a commit with this flag on will cause the merge to fail gracefully so you can handle it manually. 

Let's go over a quick example of using the command. Changes have been made to a few files in my working directory:

<pre>
$ git status
# On branch master
#
# Changed but not updated:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#
#	modified:   README.textile
#	modified:   Rakefile
#	modified:   TODO
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
</pre>

If I ran @git commit -a@ from here, all of the files would be added into the new commit. However, I want to temporarily ignore the changes in one of the files:

<pre>
$ git update-index --assume-unchanged README.textile   
$ git status
# On branch master
#
# Changed but not updated:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#
#	modified:   Rakefile
#	modified:   TODO
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
</pre>

So if we commit the work now then turn the flag off, we can see that Git didn't lose the original changes to the README. From there, you could now add them into a new commit, or "revert back to the latest copy":http://gitready.com/beginner/2009/01/11/reverting-files.html.

<pre>
$ git update-index --no-assume-unchanged README.textile
$ git status
# On branch master
# Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 4 commits.
#
# Changed but not updated:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#
#	modified:   README.textile
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
</pre>
