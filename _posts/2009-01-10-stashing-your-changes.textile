Stashing is a great way to pause what you're currently working on and come back to it later. For example, if you working on that awesome, brand new feature but someone just found a bug that you need to fix. Add your changes to the index using

@git add .@

Or add individual files to the index, your pick. Stash your changes away with:

@git stash@

And boom! You're back to your original working state. Got that bug fixed? Bring your work back with:

@git stash apply@

You can also do multiple layers of stashes, so make sure to use 

@git stash list@ 

To check out all of your current ones. If you need to apply a stash from deeper in the stack, that's easy too. Here's how to apply the second stash you've got:

<code>git stash apply stash@{1}</code>

You can also easily apply the top stash on the stack by using ("Thanks jamesgolick!":http://jamesgolick.com/):

@git stash pop@

A note with this command, it deletes that stash for good, while apply does not. You can manually delete stashes with:

@git stash drop <id>@

Or delete all of the stored stashes with:

@git stash clear@
