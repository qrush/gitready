Ever wondered how many commits you've contributed to a project? Or perhaps, which coworker has really done nothing (or maybe they have huge changes and fewer commits!) Well, wonder no more, for @git shortlog@ is a nice way to find out. 

I'm running this on my "clone of jekyll":http://github.com/qrush/jekyll, which is how this blog is generated:

<pre>
$ git shortlog -s -n
  135  Tom Preston-Werner
  15  Jack Danger Canty
  10  Chris Van Pelt
  7  Mark Reid
  6  remi
  3  Mikael Lind
  3  Toby DiPasquale
  2  Aristotle Pagaltzis
  2  Basil Shkara
  2  John Reilly
  2  PJ Hyett
  1  Marc Chung
  1  Nick Gerakines
  1  Nick Quaranto
  1  Tom Kirchner
</pre>

The @-s@ option squashes all of the commit messages into the number of commits, and the @-n@ option sorts the list by number of commits. 

This command could also be useful for changelogs, since you could easily dump all the changes each person has done. There's a few other neat options: @-e@ will append emails, and you can control columns widths with @-w@. Check out the "manpage":http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-shortlog.html for more information.
